# Basreh or Basra? Geoparsing Historical Locations in the Svoboda Diaries

## Overview

The Joseph Mathia Svoboda diaries capture over 40 years of trade on the Tigris, life, politics, and the landscape of Ottoman Iraq through the perspective of a British steamship purser with a rich family history and local connections. Of the 49 JMS diaries that we have in our collection, 3 have been published on the website, with more in progress. Unfortunately, not all of the Josephâ€™s diaries have survived, and some of those which have are in poor shape.

The data used in geoparsing is the data for diaries 47 and 48 released in the [ASIS&T 2023 Workshop "Exploring Collaborative Interpretive Practice"](https://github.com/svobodadiaries/collab-interpret).
