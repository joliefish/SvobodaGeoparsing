 But Pièrre says in his letter to the fathers that he was surprised when he received a letter from Alexander from Parîs, dated the 12th and asking him to advance him 200 frcs more, &amp; Pièrre like a fool sent him the money, it is new already 650 frcs that Pièrre has given Alexander But ought to know well that my telegrams to him expressly say that he is only to advance him on condition that he should accompany him
 I am awfully vexed and sorrow at what Pere Pièrre has been doing and all my work with him proved fruitless, I therefore made out the following telegram to him to <span class="loc">Montpellier</span>, since he is still there

Svoboda Baghdad Depart Paris presentement Impossible Cœur epris état pardonnable, lettres explicative parties, attendons consentement Sinon resultat trieste calmez patientez, Svoboda, How quick this telegram came it was sent the next day after the one I wrote, that is in about 24 hours from the time mine was sent until the time this one came
 What an answer &amp; what a daring, he must have lost his head and he must have been taught by the woman he loves or by Ibrahim Gejou That of J. Asfar is from Basreh dated the 4th he says. Svoboda, Baghdad Sevelinge Wires "Fils destiné suis impuissant engagèz père venir repatriment Asfar
 His letters from Vienna are full of affections toward us as usual &amp; he wishes to leave very soon to come to us, &amp; says that Böhm is out in the country as well as Mr. Schweiger in whose office he used to go
 etc etc, Monseigneur Altmayer had also telegraphed to Cardinal Richard on the 30 <span class="loc">Ulto</span>. this Cardinal Richard Paris Alexander Svoboda, Mon diocesain, mineur, de passage Paris 3 Place Cambronne, Veut contracter mariage, contre Volonté paternelle, Veuillez ordonner refus benediction et faire dissuader jeune homme, Remerciment respectueux Archeveque Altmayer~ He received this answer dated the 2d on the 3 Instt, Altmayer Baghdad Mesopotamie <span class="loc">Alexandre</span> Svoboda, inconue adresse indiqués Cardinal Richard, Henry had been to Dr. Rosen on Sunday last &amp; told him all about Alexander and obtained from him a Telegram to the German ambassador Count Münster in Paris thus Ambassade Allemande " Paris Oesterreicher Alexander Svoboda 3 Place Cambronne beabsichligt Heirath, Vater Versagt, Einwilligung bittet, Einsparuch erheben~ Rosen consul Allemand [4 symbol] But after he had taken it to be sent, all my sisters &amp; wife &amp; others they thought that it would be risky for Alexander on account of the Austrian Governt. Knowing his presence there &amp; may take him to serve in the military &amp; so it was not sent &amp; D Rosen Knew nothing about its not being sent
 All my sisters &amp; their daughters Antone Marine &amp; [illegible] came to us, everybody regrets this sad affair, the boy must have got mad, he has just finished his 20 years on the 7 of July last, he had got the 90 £ Stg which I sent him through Korkis <span class="loc">London</span> on the 9th <span class="loc">Ulto</span> &amp; he must got it on about the 15th he does not say that he has received it in his letter of the 15th &amp; this sum must have served him for this cursed intention he had in mind
 I am afraid that may go on drawing money from R. Korkis without my sanction, so I went to look for Yousif Korkis to let him telegraph to his brother not to advance him, I did not find him, but he soon came to me on board
 &amp; as Eliza had written letters by this last Post of the 4 Instt to Alexander, to R. Korkis to Blockey in <span class="loc">London</span>, also the Bishop wrote to Alexander as well as his other friends &amp; reprimanding him and telling him everything about his foolish idea, so Yousif Korkis &amp; I made out the following telegram, " Razkallah " <span class="loc">London</span> " Alexander Paris intention "mariage through influence "Gejou against our consent "do best prevent occurrence "by all means power, "despatch <span class="loc">Baghdad</span>, <span class="loc">Dont</span> "advance money without "order – " Korkis Svoboda (29 words) (6 Augt 98 ) Frcs 20.85 @ 71 Cts per word We sent the telegram and then we came home. Many visitors called on us today being a Holyday of the Tejelly, At 11 I went to see Monseigneur Altmayer [space] &amp; asked to make an other Telegram to the Cardinal explaining to him that Alexander can be found at Gejou at that same address &amp; Gejou will point out to him where Alexander is so he made me this telegram " Cardinal Richard " Paris " Svoboda se trouve adrèsse "indiquée chez Ibrahim "Gejou son Compatriote "et faceteur "16 mots Altmayer (6/8/98) Frcs 9.25 @ 56 Cts per word, I saw also Mr. Rouet the Consul who came to us (they being in the same house) &amp; he assured me that the mariage cannot possibly be contracted without my consent &amp; without the necessary papers documents certificates etc
 ~ I came home at 12
 &amp; soon after Yousif Korkis came to us with this disgusting telegram from his brother, Rezooki dated the 3 Instt, " Korkis Baghdad " Svoboda amoureux prostituée "son etat completement change "droits parants, lui écrivanes "venir Londres refusa "insistèz père forcer retour "<span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, autrement "consequence mauvaise What a stupid &amp; disgraceful affair this is for him and for us, &amp; what a scandel he has caused for us, all the people here know about it the friends are sorry &amp; the foes are rejoicing, they all pity this act of Alexander for every one had great esteem &amp; high opinion of him
 and all know that he is a very promising boy very intelligent, attentive, &amp; obedient to his parents What could have caused such a foolish thing. We should see by his letter of next post on the 11th. but I am sorry we shall leave on that day
~ This letter should be dated the 22 from Paris
 I have also been to Georgis Antone the merchant &amp; asked to write to his agent at Constple not to pay any money to Alexander should he send to him that letter of recommandation I got from him last time, and I suppose when he finishes his money he will commence to starve of hunger~ This is a regular blow for me, being my only beloved son to whom I had sacrificed every thing even my existence &amp; life, &amp; now he rewards me with this behaviour
