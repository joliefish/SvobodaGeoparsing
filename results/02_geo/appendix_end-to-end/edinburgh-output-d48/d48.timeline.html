 there is nothing decided in it, he only complains of Johnys letters to him in which he had given him all the advises &amp; councils &amp; told him that his complaints &amp; illness are lies &amp; humbugs, and <span class="per">Alexander</span> insists that they are all true, &amp; hopes if he leaves he will try &amp; accompany Père <span class="per">Pierre</span> &amp; all these sorts of non= sence which made me so sorry
 as I got occupied in cleaning &amp; arranging our big sitting room etc, with the servants, at about 9 am I received an other large registered letter brought by the Post man on its envelope was written in french &amp; Arabic that on no account must this letter be delivered to any other person except into my proper hands, it is dated the 13thNovr from <span class="per">Alexander</span> in answer to my long letter of the 12 <span class="per">Octor</span> which I had sent from <span class="per">Basreh</span> &amp; kept a copy
 it is about 4 sheets a most fearful one he complains of himself and confesses of all that I have written to him to be true &amp; that he has betrayed me, &amp; he is mad &amp; has lost his sense &amp; so on and does not say a word about his leaving, I was so awfully struck down from sorrow &amp; grief that I felt unable to walk or do anything I was trembling &amp; weeping, my knees got shaky &amp; powerless, I became miserable, while I was reading the letter, Père <span class="per">Emmanuel</span> called on me, with a very sorrow face and gave me a card from Père <span class="per">Pierre</span> from <span class="per">Paris</span> dated the 7th <span class="per">Novr</span> he writes to me &amp; says that Scander came to bid him his last farewell &amp; told him that he was going to leave by the Messagerie via Beyrout so as to be here by <span class="date">Christmas</span> &amp; before him, &amp; so he requires 250 frcs for his expences to travel with and Pièrre gave it to him &amp; obtained a receipt, and so the stupid Pièrre let him go &amp; paid the money against my express order in the telegrams that he is only to pay him on condition that he must accompany him, he played Père <span class="per">Pierre</span> also an other trick &amp; got 450 frcs in all from him
 I was mad from sorrow and grief, I am sure <span class="date">now</span> that <span class="per">Alexander</span> is not with father Pièrre, and that he is &amp; remains still in <span class="per">Paris</span> and in his letter he tells me that he is mad &amp; thretens to commit suicide and will never be able to see us any more

 I am afraid that may go on drawing money from <span class="per">R. Korkis</span> without my sanction, so I went to look for <span class="per">Yousif</span> <span class="per">Korkis</span> to let him telegraph to his brother not to advance him, I did not find him, but he soon came to me on board
 &amp; as <span class="per">Eliza</span> had written letters by this last Post of the 4 Instt to <span class="per">Alexander</span>, to <span class="per">R.
